<h3> 

            	I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science and Engineering at the (<a class="ta" href="https://www.unr.edu/">University of Nevada, Reno</a>), where I work with <a class="ta" href="https://www.cse.unr.edu/~mircea/">Dr. Mircea Nicolescu</a>, <a class="ta" href="https://www.cse.unr.edu/%7Emonica/">Dr. Monica Nicolescu</a>, and <a class="ta" href="https://www.cse.unr.edu/~bebis/">Dr. George Bebis</a> . My research focuses on developing robust, trustworthy AI systems for precision medicine, particularly in medical image analysis for breast cancer detection and diagnosis.

				My research addresses fundamental challenges in clinical AI deployment: (1) designing task-aware models that incorporate domain knowledge from medical imaging and clinical reasoning, (2) ensuring robustness under data limitations and distribution shifts, and (3) advancing generalizable, personalized diagnostic frameworks for patient-centered precision medicine. My doctoral work has demonstrated that incorporating domain-specific design principles throughout the AI pipeline—from preprocessing to loss function design—yields significant and consistent performance improvements in mammography analysis.


				           I received my M.Sc. in Computer Science (en route to Ph.D.) from the <a class="ta" href="https://www.unr.edu/">University of Nevada, Reno</a>, and my MSc in Computer Science and a BEng in Information Technology from Institute for Advanced Studies in Basic Sciences <a class="ta" href="http://iasbs.ac.ir">IASBS</a>.

			<h2>Using breast density for hybrid region and pixel-level loss function, <b>P Aliniya</b>, M Nicolescu, M Nicolescu, , M Nicolescu, George Bebis,  Machine Vision and Applications Jornal (MVA), 2025</h2>
			<h3>Abstract</h3>
			
			<h3><p align="justify"  style = "margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px">Breast cancer continues to be one of the most lethal cancer types, mainly affecting women. However, thanks to the utilization of deep learning approaches, there has been a considerable boost in the performance of the methods for breast cancer detection. The loss function is a core element of any deep learning architecture with a significant influence on their performance. The loss function is particularly important for tasks such as breast mass segmentation. For this task, challenging properties of input images, such as pixel class imbalance, may result in instability of training or poor detection results due to the bias of the loss function toward correctly segmenting the majority class. We propose a hybrid loss function incorporating both pixel-level and region-level losses, where the breast tissue density is used as a sample-level weighting signal. We refer to the proposed loss as Density-based Adaptive Sample-Level Prioritizing (Density-ASP) loss. Our motivation stems from the observation that mass segmentation becomes more challenging as breast density increases. This observation makes density a viable option for controlling the effect of region-level losses. </p></h3>

Mass Segmentation on Whole Mammography Images, <b>P Aliniya</b>, M Nicolescu, M Nicolescu, , M Nicolescu, George Bebis,  Machine Vision and Applications Jornal (MVA), 2023</h2>
			<h3>Abstract</h3>
			
			<h3><p align="justify"  style = "margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px"> Alarming statistics on the mortality rate for breast cancer are a clear in-
dicator of the significance of computer vision tasks related to cancer identification. In
this study, we focus on mass segmentation, which is a crucial task for cancer identifi-
cation as it preserves critical properties of the mass, such as shape and size, vital for
identification tasks. While achieving promising results, existing approaches are mostly
hindered by pixel class imbalance and various mass sizes that are inherent properties
of masses in mammography images. We propose to alleviate this limitation on seg-
mentation methods via a novel modification of the common hybrid loss, which is a
weighted sum of the cross entropy and dice loss. The proposed loss, termed Adaptive
Sample-Level Prioritizing (ASP) loss, leverages the higher-level information presented
in the segmentation mask for customizing the loss for every sample, to prioritize the
contribution of each loss term accordingly. As one of the variations of U-Net, AU-Net
is selected as the baseline approach for the evaluation of the proposed loss. The ASP
loss could be integrated with other existing mass segmentation approaches to enhance
their performance by providing them with the ability to address the problems associ-
ated with the pixel class imbalance and diverse mass sizes specific to the domain of
breast mass segmentation </p></h3>

			<h2>Parametric and nonparametric context models: A unified approach to scene parsing, <b>P Aliniya</b>, P Razzaghi, Pattern Recognition, 2018</h2>
			<h3>Abstract</h3>
			<h3><p align="justify" style = "margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px" >In this paper, a new nonparametric scene parsing approach is proposed, which has three steps: image retrieval, label transferring, and label gathering. In our approach, to incorporate the contextual knowledge in scene parsing, we propose to integrate both parametric and nonparametric context models into a unified framework. We adopt a co-occurrence graph to be our parametric context model to learn the co-occurrence frequency of objects. To consider different preferences of the co-occurring of one object with the other objects, the concept of co-occurring priority is introduced in this paper for the first time. Next, by using the learned co-occurrence graph and the contextual knowledge of the set of retrieved images, we propose new ways to incorporate contextual information in all three steps of the nonparametric scene parsing approach. To evaluate our proposed approach, we applied it on MSRC-21 and SiftFlow datasets. The results show that our approach outperforms its competitors.</p></h3>

			<h2>Similarity based context for nonparametric scene parsing, <b>P Aliniya</b>, P Razzaghi, Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE),2017</h2>
			<h3>Abstract</h3>
			
			<h3><p align="justify"  style = "margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px">Scene parsing is an important research area in computer vision that aims to provide a semantic label for each pixel in an image. In this paper, we propose a new approach for nonparametric scene parsing. Typical nonparametric scene parsing approaches have two main steps: retrieving similar images to test image and label transferring from retrieved images to the test image. In our approach, in the label transferring step, we use an objective function in which object level and context level information are incorporated. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a new contextual term which is adapted to the employed similarity distance measure in the retrieval stage. Also, we propose a new adaptive weighting procedure which balances the effects of object-level and context level terms in the objective function. To evaluate the proposed approach, we applied it on the MSRC-21 datasets. The obtained results show that our approach outperforms comparable state-of-the-art nonparametric approaches.</p></h3>
